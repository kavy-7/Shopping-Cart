# Shopping-Cart App

TechStack Used : ReactJs , Tailwind CSS

In this project, I've created an interactive e-commerce homepage using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to view a list of items that can be added to or removed from a shopping cart. The cart dynamically updates to show the added items, their quantities, and the total price.

## Features

1)You can add or remmove items from the home page.

2)You can remove items from cart page.

3)You can see the total items you have added to the cart and their total price respectively.

### Getting Started

1) Clone the repo.


2) Run the command npm run start on your terminal to render it on your local host.
